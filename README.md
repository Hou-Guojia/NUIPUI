# Code and dataset for "PQGAL-Net: Perceptual Quality Guided Generative Adversarial Learning for Non-uniform Illumination Underwater Image Enhancement"

   The NUIPUI  dataset contains 1200 real high-quality underwater images with multiple scenes and 1200 corresponding synthesized NUI images.  The data is divided into six subsets (LD-1 to LD-6) based on different light distributions.
   
   The NUIPUI dataset can be downloaded from [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JZiDrZJoaQV0B1YUU60Frw) (Password：2407) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hTaHM8_pIMhtocXoCAXiRregVOsEYiGT/view?usp=drive_link).

   The code and dataset can only be used for non-commercial purpose. If you use our code or dataset, please cite the paper.
